    "Certain techniques make that information easier to interpret and understand. In their 1984 paper titled, \"[Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods](https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/2288400?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents),\" Cleveland and McGill identify 10 elementary perceptual tasks that are used to \"extract quantitative information from graphs.\" Their premise is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A graphical form that involves elementary perceptual tasks that lead to more accurate judgments than another graphical form (with the same quantitative information) will result in better organization and increase the chances of a correct perception of patterns and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas graph design had, up to that point, been \"largely unscientific,\" Cleveland and McGill took a systematic approach in analyzing human graphical perception through experimentation. Their researched helped identify the most and least accurate elementary perceptual tasks, ordered below:\n",
